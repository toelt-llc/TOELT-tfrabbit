# Figures

- `10_measures.png`: this file contains the training time run on frodo up to 4500. The green area is filled from `min` and `max` of the possible values. 
  The black line is the average of the 10 runs.
- `raw_comparison_hours.png`: contains the execution time vs. number of neurons (with 2 layers) in log scale for frodo 1 GPU, frodo 3 GPU, mac, rpi.
- `gpu1vs3.png`: this plot contains execution time for frodo 1GPU, 3GPU vs number of nuerons (with 2 layers).
- `raw_comparison.png`: contains the execution time vs. number of neurons (with 2 layers) in linear scale for frodo 1 GPU, frodo 3 GPU, mac, rpi.
- `subplots_zoom.png`: contains the execution time vs. number of neurons (with 2 layers) in linear scale for frodo 1 GPU, frodo 3 GPU, mac, rpi zoomed on the 
  origin area.
