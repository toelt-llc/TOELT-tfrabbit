# TODO
The notebooks in this directory are used for tests to then implement the functions into the benchmark tests, and use results.

FIGURES notebooks : 
`time_animation`is the notebook which uses the CSVs produced by the `mnist_rpi4.py` in order to plot GIFs results 
`plot_results`static plots produced from the CSVs data, planning to use the means of several results

`exploration` and `mnist_rpi_benchmark`  are the first drafts with some model/output testing, will be moved/deleted 
`memory.py` will be used to test some memory usage monitoring during the benchmark programs
